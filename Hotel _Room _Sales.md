# **Hotel Room Sales in Tableau** #

Based on my 7+ years domain knowledge of hotel management and operations, I am going to debut my first tableau article on hotel rooms sales. Data is provided by one of the projects in Tableau public community - Real World Fake Data that is sourced from [data.world](https://data.world/markbradbourne/rwfd-real-world-fake-data). 

Here's the dataset in csv -- [Hospitality.csv](https://github.com/icezyf/data_projects/files/7151607/Hospitality.csv).

### **Overview** ###

This dataset contains all reservations info for 3 hotels throughout 2020. Based on average room rate, the number of stayover guests, room types, rate types, check-in date, reservation status, booking channels and etc, we summarized all-round aspects of their business operations. Sales and marketing department could generalize their inital strategic plans or framework according to this project.
